## Usage

To get flashcards from ChatGPT, you can provide it with a prompt similar to the following:

"Hello ChatGPT, please generate flashcards from these lecture notes in the format of 'Front: Your question' and 'Back: Your answer'."

Once you have the flashcards formatted by ChatGPT, open the Chat GPT Flashcards To Anki Converter application, and paste the flashcards into the text area following the specified format:

Front: Your question

Back: Your answer

For example:

Front: What is the capital of France?

Back: Paris

After pasting your flashcards, click the "Convert" button, and the program will create an Anki package that you can import into Anki.

## How To Use Chat GPT To Study

*Note: There has been an update to this iteration. Thanks to ChatGPT's custom GPT creator see link for application specific GPT: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-36G6bHP4K-ankicardgpt

ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for studying various subjects, including specific classes. To make the most of ChatGPT, follow these guidelines:

1. **Limit the sources of information:** To ensure that ChatGPT generates content based on specific resources, provide it with clear instructions. For example:

   "ChatGPT, you are a robot that takes all of your information from 2 sources: 'Principles of Neural Science, Sixth Edition' by Eric R. Kandel and 'Principles of Neurobiology' by Liqun Luo. You are not allowed to supplement information from any other source besides these 2 sources. They are all you know, and thus you can only reply with information that is directly from these sources."

2. **Ask ChatGPT to create flashcards:** To generate flashcards for studying, provide ChatGPT with a prompt that specifies the format you desire. For example:

   "ChatGPT, create flashcards on the topic of 'neural networks' using the information from the specified sources, and format them as 'Front: Your question' and 'Back: Your answer' on a seperate line."

3. **Leverage ChatGPT to become a better student:** ChatGPT can help you study more efficiently by summarizing lecture notes, explaining complex topics, and generating practice questions. For instance:

   - Input your entire lecture into the prompt, and ask ChatGPT to generate a concise summary that you can read before lab.
   - Request explanations for specific concepts or keywords related to your course material.
   - Ask ChatGPT to create a practice exam or quiz based on the content you've covered.

By using ChatGPT in these ways, you can enhance your learning experience and improve your performance in class.

## Additional Benefits of ChatGPT for Students

Besides the methods mentioned earlier, ChatGPT can be beneficial to students in various other ways:

1. **Paraphrasing and rephrasing:** ChatGPT can help you rephrase or paraphrase complex sentences or paragraphs to improve your understanding of the material.
2. **Expand on notes:** You can ask ChatGPT to expand upon or provide more details on specific points from your lecture notes.
3. **Brainstorm ideas:** ChatGPT can help you brainstorm ideas for essays, research projects, or presentations.
4. **Language learning:** ChatGPT can be a useful tool for practicing and improving your language skills, such as vocabulary, grammar, and conversation.

These are just a few more examples of how ChatGPT can be an invaluable resource for students.
